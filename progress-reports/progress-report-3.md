I have accomplished the feature of assigning different samples onto pads based on user choice. Added account registration and login abilities.

## 2. Did you achieve the previous week's goals?

My goal was to create the ability to change the drum samples on the pads and to save the kits into the database. I had trouble implementing the saving kits feature but I accomplished the option to change samples on drum pads.

## 3. What are your goals for this week?

To implement saving kits and loading kits features.

## 4. What concepts or techniques did you learn?

I have learned more about making use of data attributes in HTML and jQuery features.

## 5. What parts of the application, in the past week, were enjoyable?

To be able to change the drum samples on pads plays the main role of my application so accomplishing that feature was enjoyable.

## 6. What parts of the application, in the past week, were frustrating?

At this stage, my lack of experience and knowledge in jQuery and PHP made it hard for me to foresee possible problems I might face and to approach to implement critical features.

## 7. Did you have to radically alter something you'd finished previously?

Data attributes were added to load sample buttons to make use of them in jQuery.
