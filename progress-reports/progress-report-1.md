## 1. What features have you accomplished in the past week?

I have accomplished almost all the necessary functions in the interactive wireframe to give an idea of how the end result of my web app will look and function like.
These functions include like triggering sounds on drum pads by clicking on them with mouse, the windows that the users will see when they save and load their kits and load samples for each pad.

## 2. Did you achieve the previous week's goals?

I have built a clear wireframe that presents much information about my web app so I believe that I achieved my goals at this stage.

## 3. What are your goals for this week?

My goal for this week to design the drum pads and learn how to trigger sounds by mouse clicking so that I will learn how to embed sounds and play them with Javascript.

## 4. What concepts or techniques did you learn?

In addition to my previous knowledge of creating buttons and links on Adobe Acrobat Pro, I have learned how to import and play sounds in it.

## 5. What parts of the application, in the past week, were enjoyable?

Importing sounds into buttons and playing them with mouse clicks and also setting links to pages and creating an interactive wireframe with flawless navigation was fun.

## 6. What parts of the application, in the past week, were frustrating?

Learning how to set a default size for each page so that wireframe will have a consistent feel for users using computers with different screen sizes was a bit frustrating.

## 7. Did you have to radically alter something you'd finished previously?

No, I have not changed anything radically.
