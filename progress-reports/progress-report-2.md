## 1. What features have you accomplished in the past week?

I have created the basic layout of drum pads in HTML and CSS. Made the drum pads functional so that whenever they are triggered, the respective sound is played.

## 2. Did you achieve the previous week's goals?

My goal was to create the layout for drum pads and learn how to trigger sounds via mouse and keyboard in Javascript. I achieved the last week's goal.

## 3. What are your goals for this week?

This week I'm going to create the user sessions in PHP and design the database table for users and drum kits.

## 4. What concepts or techniques did you learn?

I learned how to make use of keys on the keyboard with the help of jQuery. For the first time, I used the 'audio' element of HTML5. I learned how to add playable sounds onto a webpage.

## 5. What parts of the application, in the past week, were enjoyable?

Making drum pads work in order to play sounds via mouse and keyboard was fun.

## 6. What parts of the application, in the past week, were frustrating?

Trying to find an easy way to make all sixteen pads playable with less code was frustrating. But with the help of jQuery, I did not even have to use any 'for' loop.

## 7. Did you have to radically alter something you'd finished previously?

No, I have not changed anything radically.
