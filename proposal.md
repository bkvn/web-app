# Interactive Drum Machine

Interactive Drum Machine is a fun drum machine that lets users trigger and play drum samples using computer keyboard.

### Features

- 4X4 Grid Layout
- Each drum pad is assigned to a key
- Samples can be played using keyboard
- Load different drum sounds on each pad
- Customize drum kit with different drum samples

## Learning Goals

- Learn Javascript frameworks for creative and multimedia work
- Explore current web technologies to see how far they can be pushed to build music apps
- Learn saving and retrieving audio samples to and from database respectively

This will be the first music/audio app that I developed in my life. I am very much interested in audio software so this app will be a start for me in this area.

### Technologies and techniques

- Javascript
- Javascript frameworks dedicated to audio work like CreateJS and SoundManager 2 
- PHP and MySQL to save drum kits and retrieve audio samples for each drum pad
